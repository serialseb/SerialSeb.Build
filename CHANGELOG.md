# Change Log

I love building stuff, but I love people knowing what I've built too. So
here's a changelog for my build files!

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.1.0]
### Added
 - You never know where you'll find a friend, so instead of being stuck looking
   in the wrong places, I know look for any nuspec anywhere.
 - It's good to know you do a great job, it's even better to know what the great
   job was, so I've improved AppVeyor messaging
 - Not all packages are the same, and sometimes other's judgement can make us
   feel excluded for being different. I value diversity a lot, so there's now
   an environment variable you can set to tell NuGet it's ok to be a different
   kind of pacakge.
 
## [1.0.1]
### Fixed
 - Only build package if nuspec is present

## [1.0.0]
### Added
 - Initial version
